# Getting Started

## Run the App


Clone this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:fathominfo/madph-lantern.git
    cd madph-lantern

This app will only work with the preprocessed data that is internal to MA DPH. If you have that ready, place it in the folder `baa/data`. Then start up the site and open in a browser:

    ./server.tool


Please reach out to hello@fathom.info with questions.
